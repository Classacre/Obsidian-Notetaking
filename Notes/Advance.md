# Gym Routine
## Workout Routine
**Terminology**
- **Feeder Sets**: These are ‚Äúramp up‚Äù sets to get the blood flowing, gauging what weight
you‚Äôre going to end up using for working sets, the sets that you‚Äôre going intense on. The
further you are into your lift, the less feeders you do because you‚Äôre already warm.
	- An example of how to set up feeders: Say you‚Äôre working set is 225, start with the first feeder at the bar for 12-15 reps, 2nd feeder at 135 for 8-12 reps, 3rd feeder at 185 for 6-8 reps, then start the working sets.
- **Working Sets**: These are the sets where you‚Äôre using the highest weight you‚Äôre going to
do for the exercise that day for your intended reps (This is gauged using the feeder sets)
- **Partials**: Partials are repetitions that do NOT go through the full range of motion. These
should only be done after repetitions cannot be completed through the full range,
occurring at the end of the set. (With the sets that go to failure + partials, try to finish in
the 8-12 rep range)
- **Rest Time**: For rest, I recommend doing a 3-5 min rest for compound movements, and 2-3 minutes on anything other movements that isolate more.
