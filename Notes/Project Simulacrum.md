# To-do
- **Reaction:** Convert **theobromine (3,7-dimethylxanthine)** to **3,7-dimethyl-1-allylxanthine (1-allyltheobromine)** via **N1-allyl alkylation**.
- **Reaction Requirements:**
    - **Substrate Binding:** The enzyme must bind theobromine efficiently.
    - **Catalytic Mechanism:** Facilitate the transfer of an allyl group to the N1 position of theobromine.
    - **Product Release:** Efficiently release the product, DMAX.
