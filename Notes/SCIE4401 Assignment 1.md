In the paper, mutants were acquired by combining both the CRISPR/Cas9 system and Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation methods to induce vector expression within the "Jack" soybean - an American soybean variety. The objective of this study was to knock out the E4 gene and analyze its impact on the flowering and maturity time of the soybean. Positive results may increase soybean production by lowering flowering and maturity requirements.

The sgRNAs were engineered using the CRISPR-P v2.0 tool - a web service for computer-aided design of sgRNAs accounting for off-target effects. CRISPR/Cas9 Target sites were selected in the first exon of E4, E4-SG1 and E4-SG2. Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation were used to insert sgRNA/Cas9 vectors in the "Jack" soybean.

Mutants were genotyped by analyzing offspring leaf genotypes through the NuClean Plant Genomic DNA Kit.  Genotypic analysis revealed that T0 transgenic plants were harboring the T-DNA of the sgRNA/Cas9 vectors and that 15.39% (2 of 13) and 56.25% (9 of 16) had heterozygous-targeted mutations at E4-SG1 and E4-SG2 sites, respectively. Additionally, the authors used PCR and DNA sequencing to analyze for E4 mutations in the T1 generation. Sequencing revealed that 27 plants from the T0 generation contained the E4-SG1 mutation, and 82 other plants from T0 generation contained E4-SG2 mutations. Mutant confirmation was done through usage of a PAT strip test for Bar gene detection, usage of Cas9 primers to detect sgRNA/Cas9 on T-DNA and analysis of flowering related genes, namely GmFT2a, GmFT5a, GmFT1a and GmFT4 in wildtype (WT) and T2 homozygous E4 mutants.

Phenotyping was done by comparing flowering and maturation times between WT and E4 mutants under short day (SD) and long day (LD) conditions. Additional metrics such as vegetative emergence, beginning bloom (R1) and beginning maturity (R7) were used to consolidate results. one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) least significant difference test was used to statistically confirm results. Results indicated that E4 mutants flowered 2-3 days earlier than WT and matured 11 days earlier under LD conditions.

The experiment suffers from various issues. One notable issue is the use of a single soybean variety. The American "soybean" may not be representative of other soybean varieties, greatly limiting the generalizability of the experiment. Additionally, this experiment primarily involves a single gene, E4, which may not always be the most prominent gene involved in flowering and maturity in other soybean variants - resulting in incomprehensive results. 

Improvements to the experimental design such as using a control group with a non-targeting sgRNA could eliminate unforeseen off-target effects, making it difficult to determine whether the observed effects are due to E4 gene editing or off-target effects. Furthermore, the small sample size may lead to a sampling issue where significance may lead to false negatives or false positives - we are unable to detect true significant differences between the mutants and the WT.
