> > What is functional genomics………Functional genomics uses genomic data to study gene and protein expression and function on a global scale (genome-wide or system-wide), focusing on gene transcription, translation and protein-protein interactions, and often involving high-throughput methods.
> 
> exceptions to this rule, e.g. non codin rna miRNA etc etc

> > Phylogenetics
> 
> how related are genes, species diverge (when a gene has an important function it is maintained how is it maintained in a population)

> > Create variants and analyse the phenotypic Consequences
> 
> bioinformatic analysis = finding what gene to change and then seeing the results of changing that gene

> can be biased to theory, may work in a closed system but not inn a real system. Cells can adjust to mutations.

> > How do you screen mutant lines ?
> 
> simplification, S1 would show the gene because primers capture whole gene, S2 shows T-DNA insertion because primer is on T-DNA insertion point
