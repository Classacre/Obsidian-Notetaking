# Compressed Notes
## Lecture 1
### Basics of Functional Genomics
• Describe various targeted genetic approaches to determine the function of a protein. 
• Describe how plant phenotypes can be used to unravel a proteins function. 
• Understand the current research themes and approaches used in reverse genetics and forward genetic screens in the model Arabidopsis thaliana 
• Critically evaluate the discussed techniques available for researchers today.

***What is Functional genomics?*** 
Using genomic data to study gene and protein expression and function on a global scale (genome-wide or system-wide), focusing on gene transcription, translation and protein-protein interactions, and often involving high-throughput methods. Essentially, the study of how genes (and intergenic regions) contribute to different biological processes.

***What is the aim of functional genomics?***
To understand the complex relationship between genotype and phenotype

Investigation of gene function is split into reverse genetics and forward genetics.
Reverse genetics:
Forward genetics:
