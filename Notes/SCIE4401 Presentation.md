# Notes
## Experiment 1 (Midlife Plasma Proteins are associated with 25 year dementia risk)
Strongest Association: GDF15
Proteins of significance: SERPINA3, CBLN4, GRID2
- Short Term Dementia risk:
	- Neuronal / Synaptic Function: CBLN4
	- Immunity: GHR and SERPINA
	- GF Binding: IGFBP2 and EGFR
- Long Term Dementia risk:
	- ALB, CLSTN3, DNAJB9, F8, FBLN5, and GDF15

**High Impact (1-5)**
1. **GDF15**: Strongly associated with midlife cognitive decline and neuroinflammation, and highly expressed by senescent cells. Although not detectable in brain, its association with dementia risk and neuroinflammation suggests a significant impact on AD. (Not AD specific protein, impact on AD is likely indirect)
2. **HSPA1B (Hsp70)**: Elevated in participants who developed dementia, and in AD brains. Its role in protein quality control and protein degradation suggests a critical impact on AD pathology.
3. **DNJB9**: Elevated in participants who developed dementia, and associated with brain amyloid, p-tau, and neurodegenerative and neuroinflammation markers. Its role in protein quality control and protein degradation suggests a significant impact on AD.
4. **GABARAPL1**: Elevated in participants who developed dementia, and associated with brain amyloid, p-tau, and neurodegenerative and neuroinflammation markers. Its role in autophagosome maturation suggests a critical impact on AD pathology.
5. **EGFR**: Associated with dementia risk and AD, and implicated in multiple neuropathological processes, including reactive astrocytosis, neuroinflammation, and axonal degradation.

**Moderate Impact (6-10)**
6. **SERPINA3**: Associated with dementia risk and AD, and may have a protective role. Its involvement in JAK-Stat signaling suggests a moderate impact on AD.
7. **CBLN4**: Associated with amyloid status and dementia risk, and involved in inhibitory GABAergic synapse formation and maintenance.
8. **GRID2**: Associated with amyloid status and dementia risk, and involved in ionotropic glutamate receptor function.
9. **MMP12**: Associated with dementia risk and AD risk, and mechanistically linked to stroke, myocardial infarction, and inflammatory conditions.
10. **CPLX1**: Nominated AD therapeutic target, and associated with dementia risk.

**Low Impact (11-15)**
11. **CPLX2**: Associated with dementia risk, but with a modest effect size.
12. **CLSTN3**: Associated with dementia risk, but with a modest effect size.
13. **FBLN5**: Associated with dementia risk, but with a modest effect size.
14. **PSIP1**: Associated with dementia risk, but with a modest effect size.
15. **EPHA10**: Associated with dementia risk, but with a reverse association between AD dementia and CSF AD and neurodegeneration biomarkers, suggesting a complex role in AD.

**ECM/Proteolysis Proteins**

- MMP12: matrix metalloproteinase; associated with dementia risk and AD risk; mechanistically linked to stroke, myocardial infarction, and inflammatory conditions.
- MMP19: matrix metalloproteinase; associated with dementia risk.

**Other Proteins**

- FBLN5: associated with dementia risk.
- PSIP1: associated with dementia risk.
- EPHA10: associated with dementia risk, but with a reverse association between AD dementia and CSF AD and neurodegeneration biomarkers.
