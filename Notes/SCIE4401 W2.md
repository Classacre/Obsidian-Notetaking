![[Metabolomics 1 2024.pdf#page=8&rect=30,28,894,467&color=yellow|Metabolomics 1 2024, p.8]]timing is important, if you were to measure at he half point of mRNA, you would fine the beggining of protein but no metabolites

![[Metabolomics 1 2024.pdf#page=15&rect=157,210,828,477&color=yellow|Metabolomics 1 2024, p.15]] we want to do many molecules at the same time, this process is done so that the ph is neutral for the mass spectrometer
