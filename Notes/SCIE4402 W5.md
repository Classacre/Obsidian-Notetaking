> Expected value of error is 0, The formula for the slope has nothing systematic missing, the formula fits well into the model even if there are small little deviations (they get washed out in the end)

![[Lecture Day3 slides_option2.pdf#page=5&rect=47,621,275,672|Lecture Day3 slides_option2, p.5]]formulas dont have error terms, so normality assumption is not needed, therefore no problem if not normal, error term pops up when we look at inference.

Understand terms such as:
Unbiased, consistency and minimum variance.

> > Consistent
> 
> enough data = no bias
