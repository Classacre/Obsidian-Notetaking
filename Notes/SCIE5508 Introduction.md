> looks life like (like mitotic spindle_ but underlying processes used to produce the pictures are very different than processes doing mitosis - hence the analogy is not proving the mechanisms going on in biology) Leduc used the wrong parts to build life, but he shared his motivation to "build to understand" life

![[SCIE5508_L2.pdf#page=7&rect=107,84,564,364&color=yellow|SCIE5508_L2, p.7]]Jacques Monod and Francois Jacob looked at Lac operon in E . coli, they found that genes are usually in off state and represses gene activity. ![](https://i.imgur.com/8o4yP2U.png)

cl-ts inhibits PL
PL required to transcribe lacl
lacl inhibits Ptrc2
Ptrc2 required to encode cl-ts

as genetic engineers, we turn on and off the promoters (cl-ts and lacl) by modifying heat and IPTG, which changes GFP to either on or off.

![[SCIE5508_L2.pdf#page=19&rect=99,659,1219,894&color=yellow|SCIE5508_L2, p.19]] creating a cheaper way to create artemisinin (anti malaria drug) - artemisinin normally taken from plants (costs $10) had the idea to extract gene that made artemisinin and put in E. coli
![[SCIE5508_L2.pdf#page=19&rect=400,786,640,836&color=red|SCIE5508_L2, p.19]] **an organic compound involved in the production of cholesterol and other essential molecules**.

![[SCIE5508_L2.pdf#page=26&rect=1238,682,1429,813&color=yellow|SCIE5508_L2, p.26]]cleave away unnecesary stuff and create a "minimal" cell

![[SCIE5508_L2.pdf#page=29&rect=34,60,707,825&color=yellow|SCIE5508_L2, p.29]]biochemists trying to find the origin of life through "bottom-up" approach, using molecules found in primordial earth to try and create simpel life. Scientists encapsulated RNA in a lipid. Under high magnesium concentrations these lipids formed a fatty acid membrane, which mitigates destabilizing effect of Mg2+, allowing RNA templates to chemically copy itself inside of fatty acid vesicles.
![[SCIE5508_L2.pdf#page=30&rect=1058,205,1301,466&color=yellow|SCIE5508_L2, p.30]]is it possible to create life from purely synthetic polymers instead of traditional DNA and RNA?

![[SCIE5508_L2.pdf#page=31&rect=932,594,1828,880&color=yellow|SCIE5508_L2, p.31]]capable of base pairing with DNA and RNA, base emoeity is identical and only backbone is changed. They have different properties than DNA and RNA (different helical twists) but can still bond with DNA and RNA
