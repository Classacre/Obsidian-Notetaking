> looks life like (like mitotic spindle_ but underlying processes used to produce the pictures are very different than processes doing mitosis - hence the analogy is not proving the mechanisms going on in biology) Leduc used the wrong parts to build life, but he shared his motivation to "build to understand" life

cl-ts inhibits PL
PL required to transcribe lacl
lacl inhibits Ptrc2
Ptrc2 required to encode cl-ts

as genetic engineers, we turn on and off the promoters (cl-ts and lacl) by modifying heat and IPTG, which changes GFP to either on or off.
