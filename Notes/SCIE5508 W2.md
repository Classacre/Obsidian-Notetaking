![[SCIE5508_L3(1).pdf#page=57&rect=26,28,1901,1036&color=yellow|SCIE5508_L3(1), p.57]]undesired reporter gene is luciferase (lux), the main issue here is we want the transcription to stop once it has expressed ecf28 - even if we use a strong terminator the expression keeps going and hits the reporter gene. The higher the concentration of arabinose = the more reporter gene is expressed, to combat this alternating orientation of transcription units and insulators (random dna) are used

B0034 is cut using EcoRI (labelled E) and Spel (labelled S)
![[SCIE5508_L4.pdf#page=8&rect=1119,736,1503,900&color=yellow|SCIE5508_L4, p.8]]C0010 is cut using Xbal and Pstl (labelled X and P respectively)

![[SCIE5508_L4.pdf#page=8&rect=773,126,1843,466&color=yellow|SCIE5508_L4, p.8]]When mixed and ligated together, they create a scar of non bindable (non palindromic) that cannot be recognized by X or S, creating an M site - a scar of 6 b between blue and green base pairs. Other sites are compatible and result in plasmid that is flanked by EX on left side and S and P on right side.

1. **PCR Product**

- This step involves amplifying the desired DNA sequence using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The product is a DNA fragment with specific overhangs.

 2. **Level 0 Entry Vector**

- The PCR product is inserted into a Level 0 entry vector. The entry vector has specific sites recognized by Type IIS restriction enzymes (in this case, BpiI and BsaI). These enzymes cut outside their recognition sites, creating compatible overhangs for directional cloning.

3. **Level 0 Module**

- After cutting with the Type IIS enzyme (BpiI) and ligating, the DNA fragment is integrated into the entry vector, creating a Level 0 module. This process is often referred to as a "one-pot reaction" because the digestion and ligation steps happen simultaneously.

4. **Transformation & Selection**

- The ligated vector (now containing the insert) is transformed into bacterial cells. A selection marker (e.g., lacZ) is used to distinguish colonies that have taken up the vector. Blue colonies indicate successful ligation, as the insert disrupts the lacZ gene, preventing blue pigment formation in the presence of X-gal.

5. **Level 0 Part Release**

- To release the inserted part, the Level 0 module is digested with another Type IIS enzyme (BsaI). This enzyme cuts the vector at different sites, allowing the inserted DNA fragment to be released and used for further cloning or assembly steps.
