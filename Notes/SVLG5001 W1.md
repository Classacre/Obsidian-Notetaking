# Notes for SVLG5001 W1
## Preparation
Reflection:
- What I know about my organisation: Melville Cares, elderly home / elderly care organisation that houses and comforts the elderly and gives them day-day tasks
- What I understand about my role: I am required to interview the elderly about their past and record their answers. I am then asked to compile and edit a video combining peoples life stories. I will be required to use Davinci Resolve to edit my videos and give the source files to my supervisor.
	- I am required to come in on either Tuesdays or Fridays for 8 hours, depending on my availability.
