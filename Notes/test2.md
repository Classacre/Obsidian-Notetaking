# Pipeline for Comparing GBM Gene Expression Noise in Seurat Data
This workflow compares expression noise between gene-body methylated (GBM) and non-GBM genes using a large Seurat object on an HPC cluster with SLURM.
## Files and Inputs

- **Seurat object:** `/group/sms029/Oliva_dataset/integrated_col_trajectories.rds`

- **GBM gene list:** `/group/sms029/GBM_Data/unique_gbm_genes.csv` (column: `Gene`)

- **Output directory:** `/group/sms029/mnieuwenh/gbm_noise_analysis/`

## Steps

1. **Export gene expression matrix from Seurat (R script)**

2. **Calculate expression noise and compare GBM vs. non-GBM (R script)**

3. **Run each step with SLURM using provided bash scripts**

## How to Run

1. Submit the export job:

   ```sh

   sbatch export_expression_matrix.sh

   ```

2. When that finishes, submit the analysis job:

   ```sh

   sbatch gbm_noise_analysis.sh

   ```


## Additional Analysis Steps

### 4. Check Genotype Diversity

To check which genotypes are present in your Seurat object, run:

```sh

sbatch batch_scripts/check_genotypes.sh

```

This will output a CSV file `gbm_noise_analysis/genotype_counts.csv` listing all unique genotype values and their counts.

  

### 5. Identify High- and Low-Noise Genes

- Calculates coefficient of variation (CV) for each gene across all cells.

- Classifies top 10% as "high-noise" and bottom 10% as "low-noise" genes.

  

### 6. Identify Responsive Genes

- Finds genes highly expressed in one cell type (identity) but low in others.

- Outputs a list of responsive genes.

  

### 7. Annotate Genes with gbM and Compare Features

- Annotates genes as gbM/non-gbM, high/low noise, and responsive/non-responsive.

- Compares gbM frequency among these groups.

  

### 8. Statistical Analysis

- Performs Fisher's exact test to compare gbM frequency in high/low noise and responsive/non-responsive genes.

  

## How to Run All Steps

1. Export expression matrix:

   ```sh

   sbatch batch_scripts/export_expression_matrix.sh

   ```

2. Check genotype diversity:

   ```sh

   sbatch batch_scripts/check_genotypes.sh

   ```

3. Run noise and responsiveness analysis:

   ```sh

   sbatch batch_scripts/gbm_noise_analysis.sh

   ```

  

## Output Files

- Expression matrix: `gbm_noise_analysis/expression_matrix.csv`

- Genotype counts: `gbm_noise_analysis/genotype_counts.csv`

- Noise analysis results: `gbm_noise_analysis/gbm_noise_comparison.csv`, `gbm_noise_analysis/gbm_noise_boxplot.png`, `gbm_noise_analysis/gbm_noise_stats.txt`

- Additional gene annotation and responsiveness results will be added as scripts are extended.

  

## Batch Scripts Location

All batch scripts and their output/error logs are in `mnieuwenh/batch_scripts/`.

## Notes

- Adjust memory and CPU in the sbatch scripts if needed (default: 120G RAM, 8 CPUs, 24h for large jobs).

- All scripts assume the conda environment at `/group/sms029/conda_environment/R`.

- You may need to edit gene names if your Seurat object uses a different format than the GBM list.
