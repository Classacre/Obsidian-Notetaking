# **CRONUS (CRispr and Omic Nanopore Utilization in Structures)**
# Notes for Project CRONUS
- **Protein Folding**: This involves predicting the 3D structures of proteins based on their amino acid sequences. 
- **Gene/Protein Annotations**: Specifically, there's an interest in proteins that are transmembrane and involved in phage receptor binding. This could involve studying proteins on the surface of cells that interact with bacteriophages.
- **Glycans and Phage Resistance**: Role of glycans (sugar chains attached to proteins and lipids) and internal bacterial defense mechanisms like CRISPR in phage resistance.
- **Nanopore Sequencing**: This technology provides long-read sequencing capabilities, which is useful for comprehensive mapping of genomes, including detecting DNA modifications like cytosine methylation.
